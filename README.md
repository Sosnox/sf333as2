1. If there's a winning move available, the computer will make that move.
2. If the opponent (O) has a winning move in the next turn, the computer will block it.
3. If neither of the above conditions is met, the computer will place its move in the center if available.
4. If none of the above conditions apply, the computer will randomly select an empty cell to make its move.

## How to Play
1. Start the game, and it will automatically assign X to the computer and O to the player.
2. When it's your turn (O), tap on an empty cell to make your move.
3. The computer (X) will make its move automatically.
4. Continue taking turns until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
5. If the game ends, a "Play Again" button will appear, allowing you to restart the game.
